# Literature

Here we list some pointers to resources that may be helpful to you
during the course. We will extend this list as the course progresses.


## Books

The following books are standard textbooks on computational
linguistics. Most computational linguists own a copy of each.  We will
frequently assign reading material from these books.

 * Dan Jurafsky and James Martin, [Speech and Language
   Processing](http://www.amazon.de/Speech-Language-Processing-Daniel-Jurafsky/dp/1292025433/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1412871485&sr=1-2). This
   is a gentle and broad-coverage introductory text, which covers more
   topics than the course, but does not always go into as much detail.
 * Chris Manning and Hinrich Sch√ºtze, [Foundations of Statistical
   Natural Language
   Processing](http://www.amazon.de/Foundations-Statistical-Natural-Language-Processing/dp/0262133601/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1412871501&sr=8-1). This
   is a more technical introduction to statistical methods in
   computational linguistics, and provides background reading on some
   of the techniques we discuss.

Note that the Kindle versions of both books are cheaper than the paper
versions, if electronic reading of scientific literature works for you.
