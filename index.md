The course "Computational Linguistics" is the introductory course to
computational linguistics for MSc students. It covers a wide range of
techniques for natural language processing. After completing the
course successfully, students will be able to read current conference
and journal publications in computational linguistics.


**Structure of the course.** We will meet twice a week for lectures and to
 discuss the assignments (see the [course schedule](schedule.html)).
 We will assign some reading material for each lecture, and will
 assume that you have read this material before the lecture. This will
 allow us to cover more ground in the lectures, and allow you to
 identify questions that you'd like to ask.

Furthermore, we will hand out six assignments over the course of the
semester.  Assignments will mostly be small programming projects that
are designed to give you a deeper understanding of the course
material.  We will prepare the assignments under the assumption that
you will use [Python](http://www.python.org) and
[NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) to solve them.  If you want to use a
different programming language, please come talk to us at the
beginning of the semester.

After you turn in each assignment, we will score it, and we will then
discuss your solutions in class.  You should be prepared to explain
your own solution to the other students.  In addition, we offer a
voluntary weekly tutorial session in which you can ask us questions
about the current assignment or anything else pertaining to the
course.

We urge you to use the
[Piazza Forum](http://piazza.com/uni-saarland.de/winter2018/cl) for this
course to discuss any content or organizational questions that arise
between classes.  Piazza allows you to ask questions, which can then
be answered collaboratively by both the instructors and the other
students.  We will also provide materials and make announcements via
Piazza, so please be sure to sign up.

**Prerequisites.** As an introductory class, this course does not
  assume any prior knowledge in computational linguistics. However,
  the programming assignments will start the first week of the course,
  and you will need to either have or develop solid programming skills
  to pass the course (roughly at the level of the Coursera course
  ["Principles of Computing, Part 2"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals)). We
  will give you a one-lecture crash course in Python, and you can
  attend the lecture
  [Introduction to Programming in Python](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/kvv/detailpage.php?id=2350)
  in parallel to this class. However, if you have never programmed
  before, consider taking only the Python course in your first
  semester, and then taking Computational Linguistics in your third
  semester.


**Grading.**
This class is worth 6 credit points, which translates into 180 hours
of work. Please schedule your semester accordingly.

The grade for the course is determined based on a *final
project*. Towards the end of the semester, you will propose a topic
for a small final project that applies or extends the techniques from
the course. Generally speaking, the workload for a final project
should be similar to that of an assignment. You will then work on your
project in the term break, and submit a working system together with a
short paper that explains what problem your system solves and how it
does this.  We will grade the project on the difficulty of the task,
the quality of your solution, and the clarity of the presentation.

In addition, you must successfully complete the *assignments* for the
course. You must submit solutions to at least five of the six
assignments.  We will then add up your two best scores from
Assignments 1-3 and your two best scores from Assignments 4-6. To pass
the course, you must obtain at least 250 points (out of 400).
